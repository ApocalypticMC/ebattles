. fix?: if we lower the max number of players, what do we do if number_players>max_number_players
 1: can only happen if event is not started yet. after that, the button is disabled
    So the only issue is with non-fixtures events, during signup, where we do not allow more than max_players
. add "player substitution" for fixtured (if no game played yet by the user we want to replace)
. Event admin "Add" non-gamers?
. Notification for deleted players?
. Add "forfeit" button for non-accepted challenges (or accepted, but not played?)
 - active matches
 - pending matches (need approval)
 - scheduled matches
 - challenges requested (not yet confirmed/accepted)
 Need to find which case
. "checkin" only makes sense for fixtured events?
. late checkins instead of late signups when checkin is enabled?

DONE
. Edit time of scheduled match
. Prevent "quit"/"kick" if fixturesenabled=1 && status='active', because deleting a player re-orders the seeds, which screws up the bracket.
. event option: allow late signup (enable/disable)
  - for fixtured, it will be disabled once 1 game is played
. event option: enable/disable signup (prevent users from signing up)

.Fixtures
 . disable challenges if fixtures are enabled

. Teams
 . need team quit event.
 . need team checkin, kick, ban in event manage page
 . delete teams should delete matches, scores, awards, ...

. Deleted items
 . Bug: when displaying an item, we should verify it is in database
  - claninfo,
  - clanmanage,
  - eventinfo,
  - eventmanage
  - matchinfo (says match deleted)

. Verify every database access.
 Check the return value, use check_qd_query()?

. Form process redirect
 - if item created -> show that item
 - if item deleted: show a page saying "item deleted", and a link to redirect
 - if can not do something: show a page saying "could not do this because...", and a link to redirect
  . clandelete (if scores>0)
