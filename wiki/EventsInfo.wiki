==Players Standing==
The rating calculation is based on each players score in a set of ranking categories.
Each category is assigned a max value which is attributed to the player who scores best in that category.
Other players get a portion of the max value, proportional to their score.
Overall score is the sum of the categories scores. 
 
==Team Standing==
In "Team" ladders, the score of each player goes toward his teams score.
This type of ladder is perfect for clan wars.
